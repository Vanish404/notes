# Diff from CSS grid and CSS Flex box

## Grid and flexbox

The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.

A simple question to ask yourself when deciding between grid or flexbox is:

* do I only need to control the layout by row or column – use a flexbox
* do I need to control the layout by row and column – use a grid
